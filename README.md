# Tamagotchi-on-LandTiger-board
This was a project for the course of Computre Architecture the goal was to produce a game similar to a Tamagotchi were there is an alien that must be fed to keep him alive.

# detail of the development
the game logic was implemented using C, and assembly code, we also had the possibility to use a library that contained many functions to interact with the components of the board.
## Landtiger board
